Encapsulation is one of the core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). It is the process of bundling the data (fields) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class, and restricting direct access to some of the object's components. This is achieved by using access modifiers such as private, protected, and public.
